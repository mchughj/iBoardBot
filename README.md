# iBoardBot

I bought an iBoardBot many years ago and have spent some time upgrading the
physical installation but never iterated on the software.  This repo
encapsulates my efforts to improve the general eco-system.

For details on iBoardBot see
their [https://www.jjrobots.com/iboardbot-assembly-instructions/](assembly instructions).
The build is a lot of fun and I would highly recommend getting one.

## Dependencies

The server code uses the [https://github.com/rougier/freetype-py](freetype-py) library in order to generate images
for text. Please use

```
pip install freetype-py
```

to install.

All fonts included here are available via the SIL Open Font license.  More can
