# iBoardBot

I bought an iBoardBot many years ago and have spent some time upgrading the
physical installation but never iterated on the software.  This repo
encapsulates my efforts to improve the general eco-system.

For details on iBoardBot see
their [https://www.jjrobots.com/iboardbot-assembly-instructions/](assembly instructions).
The build is a lot of fun and I would highly recommend getting one.
